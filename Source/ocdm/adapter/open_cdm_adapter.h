 *
 * Typically, the caller would parse the protection information for a video/audio frame from its input data and use this information to populate the
 * GstStructure info field, which is then encapsulated in a GstProtectionMeta object and attached to the corresponding GstBuffer using the
 * gst_buffer_add_protection_meta function.
